# WP Headless
A lightweight plugin to disable the WP frontend experience.

Logged in users are redirected to the editor screen for the post, while non-logged in users must log in first. This means that you can share a readable link straight to the editor, depending on your permalink settings.

Good for task management or organisation resource management.
